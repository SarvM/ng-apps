## Angular details available here...

** Understand the components which are eligible for lazy load. 
** Design the Routing Diagram to understand the flow diagram.

1. Setting the base path in the index file <base href="/">
2. Every feature should have a module to export all the components.
3. Router URL are activated and used in the browser, it won't invoke the server. 
4. URL Rewriting is required to avoid 404 page error. Server should be configured to avoid this scenario. 
5. Include commonModule to avoid issues on directive.
6. Module helps code organization and its difficult do that in javasript. 
7. Cohesive and coherence 
8. Typescript Module, ES2015 (6) Module, Angular Module
9. ES6 Module for code and Angular Module for the application. 
10. To understand the packages created for angular >> https://www.npmjs.com/~angular
11. The angular is modular
12. Directive to enhance the functionality of html element. 
13. Pipes transform the output values
14. Interface >> a specification identifying a related set of properties and methods.
15. Class  >> a class commits to supporting the specification by implementing the interface.
16. Important!! >> Use the interface as a data type. Development time only.
17. Life cycle hooks >> Create, Render, Create and Render Children, Process Change, Destroy.
18. Angular team statement >> "Angular doesn't offer such pipes because they perform poorly and  prevent aggressive minifiation"
19. Important!! >> Sorting and filtering logic should be in component itself.
20. Getter and Setter to look for a value from component and make some changes in the data... like filter. 
21. Important!! >> Service will help the component to be light weight and handle most of the logic in service. 
22. Service >> A class with a focused purpose.
23. Service >> Encapsulate external interactions, provide shared data or logic across components. 
24. Service >> providedIn: 'root'
25. Observables variable should have $ symbol -- suffix.
26. Use paramMap instead of params
27. Route Guard >> ng g g products/product-detail
28. Create separate module for products and shared >> ng g m shared/shared --flat m products/product.module
29. Every module to have >> routing and module
30. ng test
31. ng build >> build the solution -- ng build vs ng build --prod (AOT Minification)
